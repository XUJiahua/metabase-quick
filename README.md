## metabase-quick

Purpose: Visualize local csv files via Metabase, without user login and permission check, without database setup.
Use it and forget it...

Metabase is wonderful! It helps me a lot. :) 

But I have to do a lot of work for setting up Metabase: create account, create database, including import data, if I don't have one at hand. Especially when I just want to do some tiny work of data visualization, it's really a pain.

## WIP

- [x] import local csv files into local in-memory sql engine, and serving
- [ ] simplify metabase frontend, do a lot
- [ ] go server: mock metabase key api logic, the hardest...
